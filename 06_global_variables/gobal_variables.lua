--[[
    Global variables do not need declarations;
    non initialized variables return nil value.
    
    To delete an variable just assign nil as its value.
    
    Variables have no type definition, therefore,
    its type follows the type of the value.

    An variable can recive any value independent of the type
    assigned to the previous value.
